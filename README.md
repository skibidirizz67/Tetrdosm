Standard Tetris implemented in RV32IM assembly (with plans to implement other architectures). No external functions. No macros. So far Linux-only.

"A pretty ineffective way to implement tetris", one could say, -- or practically anything on that matter, -- but the goal of this project is to give me a way to explore assembly languages on practice.
